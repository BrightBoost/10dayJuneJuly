Let’s create a simple package and class structure for a bank account application.
You will create a BankAccount class with a few fields and a Main class to test your implementation.

0. Set up a Java project

1. Create a package named bank.

2. Inside the bank package, create a class named BankAccount with the following fields:

a. accountNumber (int)
b. accountHolder (String)
c. balance (double)

3. Create a package named main.

4. Inside the main package, create a class named Main with a main method.

5. Import the BankAccount class by adding this line below “package main”: import bank.BankAccount;

6. In the main method, create a BankAccount object using the new keyword and set some values for the fields.

7. Print all the values of the field to the console to verify your solution.
