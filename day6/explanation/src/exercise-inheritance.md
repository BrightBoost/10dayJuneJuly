# Inheritance exercise
Create:
- A class for Animal
- A class for Camel
- A class for Snake
- A class for your favorite animal if not included yet

The classes should extend Animal. 

Add:
- 2 specific properties to each of these classes
- One appropriate method for each of these classes
- Overwrite the method from Animal in the subclasses

In a main method, create a list of animals and add different elements to the list.
Can you get a Camel from the list and call the camel specific method right away?

## Constructors
- Give the classes specific constructors
- Don't have no-args constructors anymore (not a best practice, for the sake of this exercise)
