# Exceptions and IO
- Create a file with your favorite lyrics
- read the content of this file and write it to the console
- read the content of this file and write it to another file

## Challenges
- You will have to google this: can you revert the content of the file with the lyrics while writing it to another file
- Implement file reading and writing in your dealership app as an alternative to the static list
