# The topics

- Context API: Manage state across multiple components
- React Router: Create SPA applications with React
- Hooks: We have seen `useState` and `useEffect`. These are hooks. There are more hooks, such as `useRef`, `useReducer`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo`.
- Fetch Data from APIs: Use `fetch` or `axios` to get date from a REST API


# The project

I realize this is a little ambitious, but so are you üòè

Let's create a mini e-commerce site where users can view a list of products, click on a product for more details, add products to a shopping cart, and view their cart. More details can be found in the project description. As well as a simple Node.js API (based on a JSON file that serves as a database) that can be used to get the products.
