# Mini Project: Dinosaur Actions App

## Step 1: Modify the Base Theme

Change the person object's name to a dinosaur name of your choice.
Modify the theme colors to any two colors you think best represent dinosaurs.
Find and replace the coffee image link with a link to an image of a dinosaur.

## Step 2: Change the Todos to Actions

Rename the TodoList component to ActionList.
Replace the initial todos state with dinosaur-related actions.
Update the rest of the code to reflect this change (e.g., change variable names from todos to actions, newTodo to newAction, etc.).

## Step 3: Create the App

Replace all instances of 'Todo' in the UI text to 'Action' (e.g., in the h1 tag, the form input, and the button).
Test your app by adding and removing dinosaur actions.

## Step 4: Delete an action when you click on it

Once the `<li>` is clicked, it should be removed.

**Stretch Goals:**

- Save Actions in Local Storage

- Use the localStorage web API to save the dinosaur actions. This way, the actions will persist even if the page is refreshed.
Use External API

- Find an API that provides information about dinosaurs and use it to display additional details in your app.
Enhance UX/UI

- Improve the design and user experience of your app. You could add animations, improve the form validation, or add a 'completed' feature to the actions.

- Multiple Dinosaurs: Expand your app to handle multiple dinosaurs, each with their own set of actions.
